# Hi! Looks like you've wandered onto my Github Profile! 🐈‍⬛
#### I'm a student studying Computer Science @ CSULB!
Although my specialty falls under Software Engineering, I definitely have other interests in the broad field of Computer Science that includes Web Design, Machine Learning/AI, and many other subinterests. I'm just getting into the vast world of Github, so stay tuned!
